--> What we should test?
------------------------
o Testing component rendering
o UI elements that we write
o Functions which we write
o API testing.
o Event testing.
o Props and status
o UI condition testing | UI state testing


--> Avoid testing for:
----------------------
o External UI library code.
o No need to test default function of JS and react.
o Sometime we should mock function rather than testing it in details.


--> Important Points:
---------------------
o Do not write snapshots in starting of the project.
o Run test case after completing your functionality.
o Make a standard for code coverage.
